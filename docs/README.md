<!-- Plugin description -->
CodeTester-IDEA is a plug-in for JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA which provides a possibility for students to allow them to automatically test programming submissions against a set of student created tests.
With the aim of creating a perfectly tested program and to ensure there are no missing edge cases.

**This project survives only because students create and share tests!**

Please note, this is not an official part of the [SimpleCodeTester](https://github.com/I-Al-Istannen/SimpleCodeTester) - this plug-in is only a user interface for the underlying technology from [SimpleCodeTester](https://github.com/I-Al-Istannen/SimpleCodeTester).

**Currently the CodeTester-IDEA only works for students on the KIT in Programming 1.**
